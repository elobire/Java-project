# Java-project
My final year dissertation project, on creating a program to detect entries made by students on essay mill websites.
Essay mill's are a form of contract cheating website where students pay other people to complete assignments for them.
To use the program you must enter keywords relating to the assignment you are searching for, along with the assignment file.
The program can find matches without the assignment file, however these will be less definative and require further manual investigation.
